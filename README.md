# Setup

To set up the project run _init.sh_ for Linux or _init.bat_ for Windows. This script downloads MGLTools
and installs it.

# Development

MGLTools comes with its own Python 2.7 interpreter which should be used to run and develop scripts from this project.

Set MGLTools/bin/pythonsh (Linux) or MGLTools\bin\python.exe (Windows) as project's interpreter in your IDE.
